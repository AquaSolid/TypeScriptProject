        <p>There are two main ways to get the TypeScript tools:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Via npm (the Node.js package manager)</li>
            <li>By installing TypeScript's Visual Studio plugins</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            For option 1, you will need to have NodeJS installed and alongside it npm, a package manager. You can easily
            install them both by following this link, where we recommend that you choose to install the LTS version,
            recommended for most users. After NodeJS is installed you can verify your installation by typing
            <code> node -v</code> or <code> node --version</code> for which you will get something like
            <code>v6.10.0</code> as output. You can also run <code>npm -v</code> or <code>npm --version</code> to verify
            that the package manager has also been installed.
            Assuming you have node and npm and you’ve chosen to take on the first installation option (using npm) simply
            write this line in your command line:
            <ol>
        <p><code> npm install -g typescript</code></p></ol>
        <p>Where the <code>-g</code> is the global flag meaning that it’ll install TypeScript on the whole machine, if
            we didn’t have the <code>-g</code> global flag then npm will automatically assume that we want TypeScript
            just in the current project that we’re working in, which is actually the folder we are in at that moment
            inside the command line.</p>
        </p>
        <p>For option 2, Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 include TypeScript by default. If you didn’t
            install TypeScript with Visual Studio, you can still download it. In other IDEs such as WebStorm or PHPStorm
            TypeScript comes built-in, so you can easily just incorporate TypeScript into your projects assuming your
            project is suited for its use.
        </p>
        <h2 id="First">Making your first TypeScript file</h2>
        <p>Assuming you’ve went through with the installation process, using the editor of your choice type in the
            following JavaScript code in a file named <code>greeter.ts</code>, notice that the extensions is
            <code>.ts</code> instead of <code>.js</code>.
        </p>
        <pre class="line-numbers codeBox"><code class="language-typescript">function greeter(person) {
    return "Hello, " + person;
}

var user = "Jane User";

document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);</code></pre>
        <p>
            At the command line, run the TypeScript compiler:
            <code> tsc greeter.ts</code>
            The result will be a file greeter.js which contains the same JavaScript that we fed in.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Notes">Additional notes on transpiling, joining files and watcher (<a
                href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-started-typescript">source</a>)</h2>
        <p>The following command will compile a single <code>.ts</code> file into a <code>.js</code> file:
        <ol><p><code>tsc app.ts</code></p></ol>
        <p>This will result in an app.js file being created.</p>
        <p>To compile multiple .ts files:</p>
        <ol><p><code>tsc app.ts another.ts someMore.ts</code></p></ol>
        <p>This will result in 3 files, <code>app.js</code>, <code>another.js</code> and <code>someMore.js</code>.</p>
        <p>You can also use wildcards too. The following command will compile all TypeScript files in the current
            folder.</p>
        <ol><p><code>tsc *.ts</code></p></ol>
        <p>All TypeScript files will compile to their corresponding JavaScript files.</p>
        <p>You can also compile all your TypeScript files down to a single JavaScript file. This can reduce the number
            of HTTP requests a browser has to make and improve performance on HTTP 1.x sites. To do this use the <code>--out</code>
            option like so:</p>
        <ol><p><code>tsc *.ts --out app.js</code></p></ol>
        <p>Instead of running the tsc command all the time you can use the option <code>--watch</code>.</p>
        <ol><p><code>tsc *.ts --out app.js --watch</code></p></ol>


        <p>Every time there’s an update to a TypeScript file it’ll recompile the source files to JavaScript.</p>

        <p>If you’re using a wildcard like this, any new files created since running the tsc command won’t get compiled,
            you need to stop the watcher and start again.</p>


        <p>Now we can start taking advantage of some of the new tools that TypeScript offers. Add a <code>:
            string</code> type annotation to the ‘person’ function argument as shown here:</p>

        <pre class="line-numbers codeBox"><code class="language-typescript">function greeter(person: string) {
    return "Hello, " + person;
}

var user = "Jane User";

document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);</code></pre>
        <!--
        <h1></h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <p></p>
        <code></code>
        <pre class="line-numbers codeBox"><code class="language-typescript"></code></pre>
        -->
