# TypeScript Project

## In order to see the page you will need to have a server. The project was made using WebStorm/PHPStorm's local in-built server, but you may also use something like XAMPP.

### If you opt to use the WebStorm built-in server simply open the index.html file located in the base directory (it must be index.html, because it contains the angular scripts which join the other html segments). Once index.html is opened simply hover over the top-right corner of the built-in text editor and wait till a little toolbar appears with the logos of some of the most popular web browsers. It is recommended that you use Google Chrome, but when testing Mozilla Firefox and Opera both gave the exact same results, unlike Internet Explorer which doesn't seem to interpret the AngularJS scripts very well if not at all.

### If you opt to use XAMPP, here is a link: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
### Choose the appropriate download for your machine, for mine I used the version named "7.0.20 / PHP 7.0.20". Once installed (which can take some time), assuming you have installed it in "C:\xampp\" located the directory named htdocs within this folder, so that would be "C:\xampp\htdocs". Afterwards paste the entire project, the base directory with the index.html file in this folder (deleting all previous files in the htdocs might make it simpler, so you can do that). If you're done with that, turn on XAMPP, it is most likely that you have a desktop shortcut with the orange logo of XAMPP, turn that on, a panel will appear, turn on the Apache module by clicking the Start button and then just go to your preferred browser and go to localhost or 127.0.0.1 (same thing), there you should see the website and everything should work properly.
